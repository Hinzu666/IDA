Intelligent Driving Assistant

This project was started as a personal project for motorcycle riding. Project was to show the current location of the mobile device as well as other important information like the following: Current speed, Current air temperature, Current song playing and current time. It was important that the song playing could be skipped and stopped and that the area near the current location could be easily expolerd on map. All of the goals have been met (16.2.2023) but large bugs are still to be fixed and additional features are to be added. App is in beta testing.

Usage: when the app is started, an automatic animation will show current location. At the same time information like: time, speed and current playing song are loaded and displayed. Functions are now ready to be used. By clicking and dragging on the visible part of the map user can move and zoom the mapview exploring the area. By clicking a button labeled "re-center" in the lower-right corner, the map will re adjust the view so that the current location is at the center of the screen. Turning the device horizontally causes the app to reload but all the functions remain the same.
